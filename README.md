# Text2Scene - VoxML Framework

Based on [VoxML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01508) data representation.

A python tool to read, write and analyse VoxML data. Create VoxML data based on templates or create entirely new objects. Read and classify 3D-objects and images and modify their VoxML representation.

Based on old project: [TTLabVoxMLANnotator](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/TTLabVoxMLAnnotator).
